# Nourishly

Team Members: Hariswar Baburaj, Alan Sudhan, Gautham Viswanathan

Project Description: 

Introduction: 
- Universities often push students to eat healthy, but dining plans only offer a limited set of options that often don’t post any nutritional information. Since “you can't improve what you don't measure”, we will be developing Nourishly, a web based application that not only informs you of the macronutrients for all the meals and food items offered on campus but also keeps track of them. The website would also allow students to view menus, manage funds, and most importantly track their macros. 


Objectives:
- Provide students with details about the nutrition in the meals that they eat on campus
- Develop an application that will allow students to track their dining funds, such as meal swipes and DBDs
- Generate weekly reports of student's nutrition so that they can make more informed choices for their meals.

Scope:
- This project will focus on building a web based dining management application for students and staff that rely on campus dining services. The core features of the application are viewing menus and nutritional information, dining funds management, and nutritional report generation. Food delivery and AI diet improvements and suggestions are not within the scope of this project

Proposed Solution:
- Our website based application, Nourishly, will help students to be more informed about what they are eating by tracking their macronutrients, and manage their dining funds. It will include features such as a clean UI to view menus with clear nutritional facts. It will allow students to easily view and manage their funds, such as their meal swipes and Declining Balance Dollars (DBDs). It will also provide weekly reports that consist of how many macros, calories, proteins, etc, are consumed. Our target users are university students who want to be more informed about their diet and health such as athletes.

Technology Stack:
- Frontend: Angular
- Backend: C# .NET
- Database: PostgreSQL

Expected Outcomes  
- Students will be able to manage funds in their accounts (meal swipes and DBDs). 
- Keep track of their proteins, carbos, and other macronutrients for the food they are consuming . 
- Send a weekly report of the macronutrients from the food they are consuming.
