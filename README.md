Team Members: Hariswar Baburaj, Alan Sudhan, Gautham Viswanathan

Project Description: 
- Our website based application, Nourishly, will help students to be more informed about what they are eating by tracking their macronutrients, and manage their dining funds. It will include features such as a clean UI to view menus with clear nutritional facts. It will allow students to easily view and manage their funds, such as their meal swipes and Declining Balance Dollars (DBDs). It will also provide weekly reports that consist of how many macros, calories, proteins, etc, are consumed. Our target users are university students who want to be more informed about their diet and health such as athletes.
